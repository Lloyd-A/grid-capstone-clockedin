# Lab Management System User Stories

## User Story 1: Lab Tech - Review Shift Change Request
As a lab tech, I want to review the details of the proposed shift change and either accept or decline the request. This allows me to manage my schedule effectively and collaborate with other lab techs.

## User Story 2: Lab Tech - Receive Shift Change Notifications
As a lab tech, I want to receive notifications when another lab tech proposes a shift change with me. This ensures that I am aware of potential schedule changes and can respond promptly.

## User Story 3: Lab Manager - View Scheduled Lab Techs
As a lab manager, I want to view a list of lab techs scheduled for a particular shift. This feature helps me ensure that the right personnel are assigned to each shift and maintain efficient lab operations.

## User Story 4: Lab Tech - Provide Reason for Shift Change
As a lab tech, I want to provide a reason for my shift change request to help other lab techs understand the context. This fosters clear communication and helps colleagues assess the validity of the request.

## User Story 5: Lab Tech - Submit Shift Change Request
As a lab tech, I want to submit a shift change request by selecting the date and time of the shift I want to exchange and proposing a potential swap with another lab tech. This feature streamlines the process of requesting and coordinating shift changes.


# Submodule README - Creating a Local Database with Docker and PostgreSQL

This submodule provides a Docker Compose manifest to create a local PostgreSQL database for your project. This README will guide you through the steps to set up and use the manifest to create and manage a local database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this submodule into your project directory:

    ```bash
    git clone git@gitlab.griddynamics.net:rgilzene/clocked-in.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the submodule directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/submodule
    ```

3. Modify the values of DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_PORT in the .env file if needed, or create one if not present.

4. Start the PostgreSQL database container:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
   This command will download the PostgreSQL Docker image if it's not already available and start a PostgreSQL container using the specified configuration in the .env file.

# Knowledge Acquired

## Docker

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Key knowledge about Docker includes:

- **Containerization:** Docker uses container technology to package an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are isolated from the host system and can run consistently across different environments.

- **Docker Images:** Docker images are read-only templates that contain an application and all its dependencies. Images are used to create containers. Images are often stored in Docker Hub or other container registries, making it easy to share and distribute software.

- **Docker Containers:** Containers are instances of Docker images. They are lightweight and run in isolated environments. Containers can be started, stopped, and moved between different host systems, providing consistency in application deployment.

- **Docker CLI:** The Docker command-line interface (CLI) allows users to interact with Docker. It provides commands for building images, running containers, managing networks, and more.

- **Dockerfile:** A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, adds application code and dependencies, and configures the container environment.

## Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by containers. Key knowledge about Docker volumes includes:

- **Data Persistence:** Containers are ephemeral by default, meaning their data is lost when the container stops. Volumes enable the persistence of data between container restarts and even between different containers.

- **Volume Types:** Docker supports various types of volumes, including named volumes, host-mounted volumes, and anonymous volumes. Named volumes are often used for data that needs to be shared among containers.

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Key takeaways include:

- **Service Definitions:** In a `docker-compose.yml` file, you define services for different components of your application. Each service can have its own configuration, including image, ports, environment variables, and volumes.

- **Container Orchestration:** Docker Compose simplifies the orchestration of multiple containers that need to work together. It allows you to start and manage all services with a single command.

- **Environment Variables:** Docker Compose can read environment variables from a `.env` file or specify them directly in the YAML file. This allows you to customize service configurations for different environments.

## PGAdmin 4

PGAdmin 4 is a popular open-source administration and management tool for PostgreSQL databases. Here's what I've learned about PGAdmin 4:

- **Web-Based Interface:** PGAdmin 4 provides a web-based user interface that allows users to interact with PostgreSQL databases from a web browser. It offers a user-friendly way to manage databases, tables, users, and more.

- **Database Connections:** Users can create and manage connections to PostgreSQL databases. This includes specifying connection details such as host, port, username, and password.

- **Query Tool:** PGAdmin 4 includes a powerful SQL query tool that allows users to write and execute SQL queries against their databases. It provides features like syntax highlighting, query execution plans, and result exporting.

- **Database Management:** PGAdmin 4 offers tools for creating and managing databases, tables, views, indexes, and other database objects. It also provides support for data import and export.

- **User and Role Management:** Administrators can use PGAdmin 4 to create and manage database users and roles, assign privileges, and control access to database resources.

- **Extensions and Plugins:** PGAdmin 4 supports extensions and plugins that can extend its functionality. This allows users to tailor PGAdmin 4 to their specific needs.

Overall, Docker, Docker Compose, and PGAdmin 4 are valuable tools for containerization, application orchestration, and PostgreSQL database management, respectively. Understanding how to use these tools can greatly simplify the process of developing, deploying, and managing applications and databases.
